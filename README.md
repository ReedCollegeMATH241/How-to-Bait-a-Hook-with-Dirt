## A Study of the Writing in Celebrity Gossip Blogs and its Implications on Society's Perception of the Famous

This project looks at differences in the portrayal of male and female celebrities on the popular celebrity gossip blog, *Perezhilton.com*.  I use text mining strategies with results displayed in word clouds to emphasize the stark contrasts in langugage use between blog posts centered around male and female celebrities.  I specifically look at verb use frequencies, passive and active tenses of verbs, and the connotations of commonly-used verbs with otherwise similar denotations.
